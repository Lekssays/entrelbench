        "INSTRUCTION": "Task: Identify named entities that fall under STIX Domain Objects for cybersecurity analysis.\nInstructions:Read the given text carefully.\nIdentify named entities that can be categorized into the following STIX Domain Objects:- ATTACK_PATTERN\n- CAMPAIGN\n- COURSE_OF_ACTION\n- IDENTITY\n- INDICATOR\n- INFRASTRUCTURE\n- LOCATION\n- MALWARE\n- THREAT_ACTOR\n- TOOL\n- VULNERABILITY\n. To help you, we provide why we selected these examples.\nExamples for each STIX Domain Object:\n- ATTACK_PATTERN: \"T1055\"   This is a specific technique used by attackers to ibject malicious codes in processes.\n- CAMPAIGN: \"Operation Aurora\"   This refers to a series of coordinated cyber attacks, typically with a specific goal or target.\n- COURSE_OF_ACTION: \"Implement two-factor authentication\"   This is a specific action that can be taken to mitigate or prevent a cyber threat.\n-IDENTITY: \"Acme Corporation\"   This refers to an individual, group, or organization involved in the cybersecurity context.\n- INDICATOR: \"IP address 192.168.1.1\"   This is a specific piece of data that suggests malicious activity or a potential threat. Other examples include: registry keys, filenames, SHA256 hashes, MD5 hashes, MAC addresses, etc.\n- INFRASTRUCTURE: \"Command and Control server\"   This refers to systems, software services, or networks used to support cyber operations.\n- LOCATION: \"Eastern Europe\"   This is a geographic location relevant to cyber threat intelligence.\n- MALWARE: \"WannaCry ransomware\"   This is a specific type of malicious software designed to cause harm or gain unauthorized access.\n- THREAT_ACTOR: \"APT29\"   This refers to an individual, group, or organization believed to be responsible for cyber attacks.\n- TOOL: \"Metasploit Framework\"   This is a software tool that can be used for both legitimate security testing and malicious hacking activities.\n- VULNERABILITY: \"CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell)\"   This is a specific weakness in a system that can be exploited by attackers.\nNow, analyze the given text and identify relevant entities for each STIX Domain Object. You MUST output only NAMED ENTITIES. Do NOT OUTPUT ENTITY TYPES. Be brief. Format your response as a single line of text, listing all entities in the format \"Entity1|...|EntityN\", separated by pipe symbols (|). For example: \"Entity1|Entity4|Entity6\"Do not include any explanations or additional text in this output.\n",

        "INSTRUCTION": "Task: Identify and extract relations between entities in cybersecurity contexts using the STIX standard.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Read the given text carefully.\n2. Identify potential relations between entities based on the STIX standard.\n3. For each identified relation, explain your reasoning for categorizing it as such.\n4. Consider the allowed source and target types for each relation.\n5. If multiple relations could apply, explain your thought process for choosing the most appropriate one.\n\nExamples of STIX relations with explanations:\n\n1. Relation: delivers\n   Example: \"Cobalt Strike (TOOL) delivers the Emotet trojan (MALWARE).\"\n     The 'delivers' relation is used when a TOOL or ATTACK_PATTERN is used to deliver MALWARE.\n\n2. Relation: uses\n   Example: \"APT29 (THREAT_ACTOR) uses PowerShell Empire (TOOL) for post-exploitation activities.\"\n     The 'uses' relation indicates that a THREAT_ACTOR, CAMPAIGN, or ATTACK_PATTERN is utilizing a specific TOOL or MALWARE.\n\n3. Relation: targets\n   Example: \"The Ryuk ransomware (MALWARE) targets healthcare organizations (IDENTITY).\"\n     The 'targets' relation shows that a MALWARE, THREAT_ACTOR, or CAMPAIGN is focusing on a specific IDENTITY, LOCATION, or VULNERABILITY.\n\n4. Relation: attributed-to\n   Example: \"Operation CloudHopper (CAMPAIGN) is lead by APT10 (THREAT_ACTOR).\"\n     The 'attributed-to' relation links a CAMPAIGN to the THREAT_ACTOR believed to be responsible for it.\n\n5. Relation: mitigates\n   Example: \"Implementing network segmentation (COURSE_OF_ACTION) mitigates TA0008 (ATTACK_PATTERN).\"\n     The 'mitigates' relation shows how a COURSE_OF_ACTION can reduce the risk or impact of a specific ATTACK_PATTERN, MALWARE, or VULNERABILITY.\n\n6. Relation: indicates\n   Example: \"We found out that Zeus (MALWARE) has Internationaljobsite[.]com as a hardcoded domain .\"\n     The 'indicates' relation links an INDICATOR to the THREAT_ACTOR, CAMPAIGN, or MALWARE it suggests.\n\n7. Relation: communicates-with\n   Example: \"The Zeus botnet (MALWARE) communicates with command and control servers (INFRASTRUCTURE).\"\n     The 'communicates-with' relation shows network communications between MALWARE or INFRASTRUCTURE and other INFRASTRUCTURE or INDICATORS.\n\n8. Relation: variant-of\n   Example: \"TrickBot (MALWARE) is a variant of Dyre (MALWARE).\"\n     The 'variant-of' relation indicates that one MALWARE is a modified version or derivative of another MALWARE.\n\n9. Relation: exploits\n   Example: \"The EternalBlue exploit (MALWARE) exploits the SMBv1 vulnerability (VULNERABILITY).\"\n     The 'exploits' relation shows that a specific MALWARE takes advantage of a known VULNERABILITY.\n\n10. Relation: impersonates\n    Example: \"The threat group (THREAT_ACTOR) impersonates IT support staff (IDENTITY) in their phishing campaigns.\"\n      The 'impersonates' relation indicates that a THREAT_ACTOR is pretending to be a specific IDENTITY to carry out their attacks.\n\nNow, analyze the given text and identify relevant relations between entities according to the STIX standard. You MUST output only NAMED ENTITIES. Do NOT OUTPUT entity types. Be brief. Format your response as a single line of text, listing all relations in the format \"Source->Target\", separated by pipe symbols (|). For example: \"Entity1->Entity2|Entity3->Entity4|Entity5->Entity6\"Do not include any explanations or additional text in this output.\n",
